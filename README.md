# hello-world
My very first repository

I have little prior knowledge on how to program, but I am an eager learner. I have previously coded in Python and in R, however these projects have been quite limited in their scope. My goal with this github-account is to make a commitment to improve my skills such that I one day may realize my ambitions for different projects.

Currently, I am interested in textual analysis and machine learning.

A project I have dreamt of doing is to make an AI that is able to rewrite text, and I wish to test whether or not my ideas have potential. Another project is to make my own aqua-ponics, however this is a long-term project as I will need hardware and learn how to configure a large scope of things.
